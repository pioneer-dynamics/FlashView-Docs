## What is FlashView?

FlashView provides an easy solution for sharing sensitive information securely:

1. One-time access: Shared secrets can be retrieved only once, after which they are permanently deleted.

2. No registration required: No login or registration needed for access to basic features

3. Customizable expiration: You choose when a secret expires.

4. Intuitive interface: Share secrets easily with our user-friendly design

5. End-to-end Encrypted: We do not even know the secret as the browser already encrypts it before it reaches our server.

6. Open-source: Review our codebase for enhanced transparency
